# Ticket #090:  Account Locked - Unable to Access "Prolific Planner" App

**Customer:**  Jane Doe (jane.doe@email.com)

**Date Submitted:** October 26, 2023

**Product:** Prolific Planner Mobile App (iOS)

**Reported Problem:**

* Customer reports being unable to access her Prolific Planner account.  She received an email stating her account was locked due to "too many incorrect login attempts."  She assures us she only attempted to log in twice.  She tried resetting her password using the in-app function, but it didn't work.  She provided the following error message:  "Password reset failed. Please try again later."


**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Verification:** Confirmed customer's email address and associated account.
2. **Account Status:** Checked account status and found it indeed locked.
3. **Login Attempts:** Reviewed login logs; revealed only one failed attempt originating from her usual IP address. A second attempt, originating from an unfamiliar location (potentially a VPN), was also detected.
4. **Manual Unlock:** Manually unlocked the customer's account.
5. **Password Reset:** Guided the customer through a password reset via email, circumventing the in-app function which appeared to be temporarily malfunctioning.
6. **Security Advice:** Advised the customer to review her app permissions and password security practices.


**Final Outcome:**

Customer successfully logged back into her Prolific Planner account after resetting her password via email.  The issue with the in-app password reset function has been escalated to the development team for investigation. The customer expressed satisfaction with the resolution.
