# Ticket #098:  Account Login Issue - "Incorrect Password" Error

**Customer:** John Doe (johndoe@email.com)
**Product:**  CloudSync Pro (Version 2.1.3)
**Date Submitted:** October 26, 2023

**Reported Problem:**

Mr. Doe reports being unable to log into his CloudSync Pro account. He receives an "Incorrect Password" error message, even though he is certain he is entering the correct credentials. He has tried multiple times, and also tried resetting his password via the "Forgot Password" link, but the reset email never arrives.  He mentions he previously successfully accessed the account earlier this week.


**Resolution Steps:**

* **Step 1:** Verified the customer's email address (johndoe@email.com).
* **Step 2:** Checked for any unusual login activity from unfamiliar IP addresses.  None detected.
* **Step 3:** Manually reset the customer's password. A temporary password was generated and sent to johndoe@email.com.
* **Step 4:** Confirmed email delivery (check was made on email logs). A second password reset email was sent in case the first was caught in spam.
* **Step 5:**  The customer confirmed receipt of the temporary password and successful login.


**Final Outcome:**

The issue was resolved by manually resetting the customer's password. The problem was likely caused by a temporary glitch in the password reset email delivery system.  The customer was able to regain access to their CloudSync Pro account and confirmed successful file synchronization.
