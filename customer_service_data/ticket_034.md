**Customer:** John Smith (john.smith@email.com)
**Product:**  CloudSync Pro

**Date Submitted:** 2024-10-27 10:30 AM PST

**Reported Problem:**

Customer reports being unable to access his CloudSync Pro account. He receives the error message "Account Locked: Too many failed login attempts. Please reset your password."  He claims he has only attempted to log in twice and is unsure why his account is locked.  He also mentions he uses a password manager and is certain he is entering his password correctly.

**Resolution Process:**

* **10:45 AM PST:** Ticket assigned to support agent, Alex Johnson.
* **10:50 AM PST:** Agent Alex contacted John via email (john.smith@email.com) to confirm his email address and request a password reset.
* **11:00 AM PST:**  John confirmed his email address and reported receiving a password reset link.
* **11:15 AM PST:** John reported successfully resetting his password and regaining access to his CloudSync Pro account.
* **11:20 AM PST:** Agent Alex verified account access.  Preliminary investigation revealed no unusual login activity from unusual IP addresses.  The account lock likely triggered due to a temporary issue with John's password manager software.


**Final Outcome:**

Customer account access restored.  The issue appears to be related to a temporary conflict with the customer's password manager.  No security breach detected.
