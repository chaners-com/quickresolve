## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of QuickResolve seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Process

1. **Do not create a public GitHub issue** for the vulnerability
2. **Email us directly** at [security@quickresolve.com](mailto:security@quickresolve.com) (replace with actual email)
3. **Include detailed information** about the vulnerability:
   - Description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Include in Your Report

- **Vulnerability Type**: (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- **Affected Component**: (e.g., frontend, ingestion-service, embedding-service)
- **Severity Level**: (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Proof of Concept**: (if applicable)
- **Environment Details**: (OS, browser, Docker version, etc.)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity and complexity

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   - Regularly update Docker images
   - Monitor for security advisories

2. **Secure Configuration**
   - Use strong passwords for database and MinIO
   - Keep API keys secure and rotate regularly
   - Use HTTPS in production

3. **Network Security**
   - Restrict access to service ports
   - Use firewalls and network segmentation
   - Monitor network traffic

4. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Regular backups with encryption

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly audit dependencies
   - Use dependency scanning tools
   - Keep packages updated

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Use role-based access control
   - Secure session management

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information disclosure
- **Container Security**: Docker containers with minimal attack surface
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and request validation

### Planned Security Enhancements

- [ ] Authentication and authorization system
- [ ] API key management and rotation
- [ ] Audit logging and monitoring
- [ ] Data encryption at rest and in transit
- [ ] Security headers implementation
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning in CI/CD

## Security Checklist

### Before Deployment

- [ ] All dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] API keys are secure and not hardcoded
- [ ] Database passwords are strong
- [ ] Network access is properly restricted
- [ ] SSL/TLS is configured (for production)

### Regular Security Tasks

- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Review access logs weekly
- [ ] Audit user permissions quarterly
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Review security configurations

## Known Security Considerations

### Development Environment

This application is designed for development and testing use. For production deployment, consider:

1. **Authentication**: Implement proper user authentication
2. **Authorization**: Add role-based access controls
3. **HTTPS**: Use SSL/TLS encryption
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting
5. **Monitoring**: Add security monitoring and alerting
6. **Backup**: Implement secure backup procedures

### API Security

- API endpoints are currently unprotected
- Consider implementing API key authentication
- Add request rate limiting
- Implement proper input validation

### Data Security

- Sensitive data should be encrypted
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Regular security audits
- Compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, etc.)
