# Ticket #069:  Account Locked - Unable to Access "Prolific Planner" App

**Customer:**  Jane Doe (jane.doe@email.com)

**Product:** Prolific Planner (iOS App, Version 3.2.1)

**Reported Problem:**

Customer reports being unable to access her Prolific Planner account.  She receives an "Incorrect Password" error message after multiple attempts. She assures us she is entering her password correctly and has tried resetting her password via the in-app function, but the reset email never arrives.  She also notes that she recently changed her phone number and updated her account information a few days ago.


**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Checked account status. Confirmed account was locked due to multiple failed login attempts.
* **Step 2:** Manually unlocked the account.
* **Step 3:** Investigated email delivery. Discovered a temporary server-side issue impacting password reset emails for users who recently updated their phone number. Issue has been escalated to the Development team. (Ticket #1247 created)
* **Step 4:** Sent Jane a temporary password via email to jane.doe@email.com.
* **Step 5:** Advised Jane to change her password after logging in with the temporary password.
* **Step 6:** Confirmed successful login with Jane via a short phone call.

**Final Outcome:**

Customer account unlocked.  Issue with email delivery acknowledged and reported.  Customer successfully logged in and changed her password.
