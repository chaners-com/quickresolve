# Ticket #091:  "Chronos Pro" App Crashing on iOS 16.2

**Customer:**  Jane Doe (jane.doe@email.com)

**Reported Problem:**

Ms. Doe reports that the Chronos Pro time-tracking app (version 2.3.1) crashes consistently on her iPhone 13 Pro Max running iOS 16.2.  The app crashes immediately upon launch, displaying a generic "Chronos Pro has unexpectedly quit" error message. She's tried restarting her phone, and reinstalling the app, but the problem persists. She uses the app daily for work and is experiencing significant disruption.


**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Confirmed the reported issue with Ms. Doe via email.  Requested diagnostic logs from her device.
* **Step 2:** Received diagnostic logs.  Analysis showed a conflict with a recently updated background location service within iOS 16.2.
* **Step 3:** Advised Ms. Doe to temporarily disable background location access for Chronos Pro in her iPhone's settings.
* **Step 4:**  Ms. Doe confirmed that disabling background location access resolved the crash issue.  The app launched and functioned as expected.

**Final Outcome:**

The issue was resolved by disabling background location access for the Chronos Pro app in iOS settings.  A temporary workaround was successfully implemented.  A note has been added to our development team's bug tracker to investigate and fix the compatibility issue with iOS 16.2's location services in a future update. Ms. Doe was informed of this, and expressed satisfaction with the resolution.
