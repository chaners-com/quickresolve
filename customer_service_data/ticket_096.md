# Ticket #096:  Account Login Issue -  "Incorrect Password" Error

**Customer:**  Jane Doe (jane.doe@email.com)
**Product:**  CloudSync Pro (Version 2.1.3)
**Date Submitted:** October 26, 2023


**Reported Problem:**

Ms. Doe reports she is unable to log into her CloudSync Pro account. She receives an "Incorrect Password" error message despite claiming to be entering her password correctly. She has tried resetting her password via the "Forgot Password" link multiple times, but the reset email never arrives.


**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Checked Ms. Doe's email address for typos. Confirmed the address was correct.
* **Step 2:** Checked CloudSync Pro server logs for any potential password reset email delivery issues. Discovered a temporary SMTP server outage between 10:00 AM and 10:30 AM on October 26th.
* **Step 3:** Manually reset Ms. Doe's password.  A new temporary password was generated:  "TempPasswOrd123!"
* **Step 4:**  Sent Ms. Doe an email (sent from a different, working SMTP server) containing her temporary password and instructions to change it upon login.  Confirmation email was sent to jane.doe@email.com at 11:15 AM.
* **Step 5:** Confirmed with Ms. Doe via email that she received the temporary password and successfully logged in.


**Final Outcome:**

The issue was resolved.  The problem stemmed from a temporary SMTP server outage which prevented password reset emails from being delivered.  Manual password reset and subsequent communication resolved the login problem.  Ms. Doe confirmed successful login.
