# Ticket #080:  Unable to Access Cloud Storage - "Error Code: 403 Forbidden"

**Customer:**  Jane Doe (jane.doe@email.com)
**Product:**  CloudSync Pro
**Date Submitted:** 2024-10-27


**Reported Problem:**

Ms. Doe reports being unable to access her CloudSync Pro account.  She receives an "Error Code: 403 Forbidden" message when attempting to log in via the web application and the mobile app.  She states she has not changed her password recently and has a reliable internet connection.  She also confirmed she has tried clearing her browser cache and cookies.

**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Verified customer's account details.  Account found active.
* **Step 2:** Checked CloudSync Pro server status â€“ no reported outages.
* **Step 3:**  Requested Ms. Doe try accessing the account from a different browser (Chrome).  Issue persisted.
* **Step 4:**  Requested Ms. Doe try accessing the account from a different device. Issue persisted.
* **Step 5:**  Password reset initiated and emailed to jane.doe@email.com.
* **Step 6:**  Ms. Doe confirmed successful login using the new password.


**Final Outcome:**

The issue was resolved by resetting the customer's password.  The "Error Code: 403 Forbidden" appears to have been caused by a temporary account lock, possibly triggered by multiple failed login attempts (though the customer denied this).
