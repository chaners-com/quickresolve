# Ticket #046:  Account Login Issue -  "Incorrect Password" Error

**Customer:**  Jane Doe (jane.doe@email.com)
**Product:**  SecureCloud Pro

**Reported Problem:**

Customer Jane Doe reports being unable to log in to her SecureCloud Pro account. She receives an "Incorrect Password" error message despite claiming to have tried multiple times with what she believes to be the correct password. She has also tried using her password reset function but reports not receiving the reset email. She speculates that there may be an issue with the email delivery system or her account itself.


**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Checked SecureCloud Pro server logs for any email delivery failures. No failures were detected.
* **Step 2:** Checked customer's spam/junk folders for the password reset email.  The email was found in the spam folder. 
* **Step 3:**  Advised the customer to add "noreply@securecloudpro.com" to her email safe sender list.
* **Step 4:**  Customer successfully received and used the password reset email to regain access to her account.
* **Step 5:**  Confirmed account functionality and access with the customer.


**Final Outcome:**

The issue was resolved. The password reset email was found in the customer's spam folder.  The problem was caused by an overzealous spam filter. The customer successfully reset her password and has confirmed access to her SecureCloud Pro account.
