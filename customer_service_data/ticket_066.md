# Ticket #066:  "CloudSync Pro" - Unable to Sync Files After Update

**Customer:** John Smith (john.smith@email.com)

**Date Submitted:** 2024-10-27

**Product:** CloudSync Pro (Version 3.2.1)

**Reported Problem:**

Mr. Smith reports being unable to sync files to his CloudSync Pro account after updating the software to version 3.2.1.  He receives the error message:  "Synchronization Failed:  Error Code: CS-403.  Check network connection."  He states his internet connection is stable and other applications are working correctly.  He's tried restarting his computer and the CloudSync Pro application without success.


**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Verified customer's internet connectivity.  Ping test and traceroute confirmed stable connection.
* **Step 2:** Confirmed CloudSync Pro service status - no reported outages.
* **Step 3:**  Requested customer to check CloudSync Pro application logs for further details. (See attached log file - log_066.txt)  Log revealed a conflict with an outdated firewall rule.
* **Step 4:** Advised customer to temporarily disable their firewall and attempt a sync.  Successful.
* **Step 5:** Guided customer through updating their firewall rules to allow CloudSync Pro access on ports 8080 and 443.
* **Step 6:**  Confirmed successful synchronization after firewall rule update.

**Final Outcome:**

The issue was resolved by updating the customer's firewall rules.  The error "Synchronization Failed: Error Code: CS-403" was caused by an improperly configured firewall preventing CloudSync Pro from accessing necessary ports.  The customer confirmed successful synchronization and is now able to use the application without issue.
