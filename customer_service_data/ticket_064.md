# Ticket #064:  Account Locked - Unable to Access "Prolific Planner" App

**Customer:**  Jane Doe (jane.doe@email.com)

**Date Submitted:** October 26, 2023

**Product:** Prolific Planner Mobile App (iOS)

**Keywords:** Account Locked, Login Issue, iOS, Password Reset, Two-Factor Authentication


**Reported Problem:**

Ms. Doe reports that she is unable to access her Prolific Planner app.  She receives an error message: "Account temporarily locked due to too many incorrect login attempts. Please reset your password." She states she's tried resetting her password multiple times using the in-app option, but continues to receive the same error message.  She suspects her email address might be slightly incorrect as she recently changed her phone number.


**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Verified customer's email address.  A slight typo was found (jane.doe@emai.com instead of jane.doe@email.com).
* **Step 2:** Corrected email address in our system.
* **Step 3:**  Sent a password reset link to the corrected email address (jane.doe@email.com).
* **Step 4:** Confirmed with Ms. Doe that she received and successfully used the password reset link.
* **Step 5:**  Advised Ms. Doe to enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for enhanced security in the future.  Provided a link to our 2FA setup guide.


**Final Outcome:**

The issue was resolved. Ms. Doe successfully regained access to her Prolific Planner account after her email address was corrected.  She expressed gratitude for the swift resolution.
