# Ticket #047:  Account Login Issue -  "Incorrect Password" Error

**Customer:** John Doe (johndoe@email.com)

**Product:**  Proxima Cloud Storage (Premium Subscription)

**Date Submitted:** October 26, 2023

**Reported Problem:**

* Customer reports being unable to log into his Proxima Cloud Storage account.
* He receives an "Incorrect Password" error message repeatedly, despite claiming to be entering his password correctly.
* He has tried resetting his password using the "Forgot Password" function, but the reset email isn't arriving in his inbox (he checked spam/junk folders).


**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Verified customer email address and account information.
* **Step 2:** Checked server logs for any unusual login attempts from John Doe's IP address.  No suspicious activity detected.
* **Step 3:**  Investigated potential email delivery issues. Discovered a temporary problem with email delivery to johndoe@email.com due to a DNS propagation delay.
* **Step 4:** Manually resent the password reset email.
* **Step 5:** Confirmed with the customer that he received the email and successfully reset his password.


**Final Outcome:**

The issue was resolved.  The problem was caused by a temporary glitch in email delivery, not a Proxima Cloud Storage account issue. The customer successfully reset his password and can now access his account.
