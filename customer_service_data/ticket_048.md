# Ticket #048:  Unable to Access Cloud Storage - Account Suspended

**Customer:** John Doe (john.doe@example.com)

**Date Submitted:** 2024-10-27

**Product:**  CloudSync Pro

**Reported Problem:**

Customer reports being unable to access their CloudSync Pro account. They receive an error message: "Account Suspended:  Violation of Terms of Service - Excessive Data Upload."  John Doe states he did not upload excessive data and believes this is an error. He's concerned about losing his important business files.


**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Verified customer identity via email and security questions.
* **Step 2:** Reviewed customer's CloudSync Pro account usage logs.  Discovered a spike in uploads originating from an unfamiliar IP address in Jakarta, Indonesia.  This IP address was flagged due to previous abuse reports.
* **Step 3:** Suspected unauthorized account access.  Temporarily suspended the account to prevent further data loss.
* **Step 4:**  Reset customer's password.
* **Step 5:**  Notified the customer of the unauthorized access and the account suspension. Advised them to review their connected devices and update their password.
* **Step 6:**  Removed the suspicious IP address from the allowed access list.
* **Step 7:**  Restored customer's account access.

**Final Outcome:**

The account suspension was a result of unauthorized access from a compromised device. The customer's account has been restored and their password reset. John Doe was advised on best practices for account security, including enabling two-factor authentication.  He confirmed access to his files and expressed satisfaction with the resolution.
