# Ticket #094:  Unable to Access Cloud Storage - Account Locked

**Customer:**  Jane Doe (jane.doe@email.com)
**Product:**  CloudSync Pro

**Reported Problem:**

Customer reports being unable to access her CloudSync Pro account (account ID: CS-1234567). She receives an error message stating "Account temporarily locked due to multiple failed login attempts."  She assures us she has not made multiple incorrect login attempts and believes her password may have been compromised.  She is concerned about the security of her data.  She last accessed the account approximately 24 hours ago.

**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:**  Verified customer identity via email and security questions.
* **Step 2:**  Unlocked the CloudSync Pro account.
* **Step 3:**  Advised the customer to change her password immediately to a strong, unique password.  She confirmed password update was successful.
* **Step 4:**  Checked account logs for any suspicious activity. No unusual login attempts were detected outside of the customer's normal access patterns. We suspect a simple typographical error led to the lockout.
* **Step 5:**  Recommended enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security, which the customer agreed to and activated.
* **Step 6:**  Followed up with the customer via email (confirmation sent to jane.doe@email.com) to ensure the issue was resolved and to answer any further questions.

**Final Outcome:**

The customer's CloudSync Pro account was successfully unlocked. The customer changed her password and enabled 2FA.  The customer confirmed successful account access and expressed satisfaction with the resolution.  No data breach was detected.
