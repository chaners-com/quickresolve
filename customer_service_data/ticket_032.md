# Ticket #032:  Account Locked - Unable to Access "CloudSync Pro"

**Customer:** John Doe (john.doe@email.com)

**Date Submitted:** October 26, 2023

**Product:** CloudSync Pro (Version 3.1.2)

**Reported Problem:**

Mr. Doe reports that his CloudSync Pro account is locked and he is unable to access his files.  He received an error message: "Account temporarily locked due to too many incorrect password attempts. Please reset your password."  He has attempted to reset his password via the provided link, but the reset email never arrives in his inbox (he checked spam/junk folders). He states he is certain of his password.


**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Checked for account suspension.  Account was not suspended.
* **Step 2:** Confirmed Mr. Doe's email address (john.doe@email.com).
* **Step 3:** Manually reset Mr. Doe's password. A temporary password was generated ("TempPasswOrd123!").
* **Step 4:** Sent password reset email to john.doe@email.com from a different email server to bypass potential email delivery issues. 
* **Step 5:** Confirmed email delivery with Mr. Doe via a follow-up phone call. 
* **Step 6:**  Advised Mr. Doe to change his temporary password to a strong, unique password upon successful login.

**Final Outcome:**

Mr. Doe successfully logged into his CloudSync Pro account using the temporary password. He confirmed he received the email and changed his password successfully. The issue is resolved.
