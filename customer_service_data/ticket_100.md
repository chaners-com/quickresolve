# Ticket #100: Unable to Access Cloud Storage - Account Locked

**Customer:** John Smith (john.smith@example.com)
**Product:** CloudSync Pro

**Reported Problem:**

* Customer reports being unable to access his CloudSync Pro account. He receives an error message: "Account temporarily locked due to multiple failed login attempts."  He assures us he has not forgotten his password.  He attempted to reset his password using the password reset link, but the email with the reset link never arrived.


**Resolution Process:**

1. **Checked Spam/Junk Folders:** Confirmed with the customer that he checked his spam and junk folders for the password reset email.  None found.

2. **Investigated Account:** Reviewed account logs.  Detected an unusual number of login attempts from an unknown IP address (192.168.1.100) originating in a different geographical location than the customer's usual login location.

3. **Temporarily Unlocked Account:**  Unlocked the account to allow access.

4. **Password Reset:**  Manually reset the customer's password and sent a notification email to john.smith@example.com using a verified alternative email address associated with his account.

5. **Security Review:**  Initiated a security review of the account to ascertain how the unauthorized access attempts occurred. The customer is advised to review his device security.

6. **Confirmed Access:**  Confirmed with the customer that he has successfully logged in with his new password and can access his files.

**Final Outcome:**

The customer's account access was restored successfully. A new password has been set. The potential security breach was addressed, and additional security measures are being investigated.  The customer reported satisfaction with the resolution.
