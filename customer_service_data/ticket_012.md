# Ticket #012:  Unable to Access Cloud Storage - "Error Code: 403"

**Customer:** John Doe (john.doe@email.com)
**Product:**  CloudSync Pro

**Reported Problem:**

Customer reports being unable to access his CloudSync Pro cloud storage. He receives a "Error Code: 403: Forbidden" message when attempting to log in via the desktop application (version 2.3.1) and the web portal.  He states he hasn't changed his password recently and has a stable internet connection. He also reports trying to reset his password, but the reset email never arrived.

**Resolution Steps:**

* **Step 1:** Checked customer's email address for accuracy. Confirmed john.doe@email.com is correct.
* **Step 2:** Investigated potential email delivery issues.  Found that emails to john.doe@email.com were being filtered to the spam folder by the customer's email provider.
* **Step 3:**  Instructed the customer to check their spam/junk folder for password reset emails.
* **Step 4:** Customer confirmed receipt of password reset email and successfully reset his password.
* **Step 5:** Customer successfully logged into CloudSync Pro via both the desktop application and web portal.
* **Step 6:** Confirmed file access and functionality.


**Final Outcome:**

Issue resolved. Customer successfully regained access to their CloudSync Pro account.  The problem stemmed from the customer's email provider filtering password reset emails to the spam folder.
