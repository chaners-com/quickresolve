# Ticket #058:  Unable to Access Cloud Storage - Account Locked

**Customer:**  Jane Doe (jane.doe@example.com)

**Product:**  CloudSync Pro

**Date Submitted:** 2024-10-27

**Reported Problem:**

Customer reports being unable to access her CloudSync Pro account.  She receives an "Account Locked: Too many incorrect login attempts" message when trying to log in. She states she's sure of her password and has tried resetting it using the "Forgot Password" link, but hasn't received the reset email.  She also mentions she was trying to access files urgently related to a presentation.

**Resolution Steps:**

* **Step 1:** Checked account status in the CloudSync Pro admin panel.  Confirmed account was indeed locked due to multiple failed login attempts.
* **Step 2:**  Investigated email delivery logs for password reset requests from jane.doe@example.com. Discovered the reset email was sent but appeared to have been flagged as spam by the customer's email provider (Gmail).
* **Step 3:**  Contacted the customer via phone to confirm her email address and verify her identity.
* **Step 4:** Manually unlocked the customer's CloudSync Pro account.
* **Step 5:**  Walked the customer through accessing her account and changing her password to a stronger one.  Recommended checking her spam folder for future password reset emails.
* **Step 6:**  Confirmed customer access to her files.

**Final Outcome:**

Customer access to her CloudSync Pro account was restored. Issue resolved.  The customer expressed gratitude for the quick resolution.
