**Product:** Promethium X500 Smart Home Hub

**Reported Problem:**

Mr. Smith reports he is unable to connect his Promethium X500 Smart Home Hub to his home Wi-Fi network. He has tried multiple times, receiving the error message: "Network Connection Failed:  Unable to obtain IP address."  He has confirmed his Wi-Fi password is correct and other devices are connecting without issue.  He's using a 2.4 GHz network.

**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Verified customer's Wi-Fi network details and confirmed password accuracy.

* **Step 3:**  After reboot, the customer still reported the same error.
* **Step 4:**  Suggested the customer try connecting to the Wi-Fi network using a different method (instead of the Quick Start wizard he was using). This involved manually entering the network SSID and password.
* **Step 5:** Customer successfully connected using the manual entry method.
* **Step 6:**  Confirmed all features of the hub are functioning correctly post-connection.
* **Step 7:**  Provided further troubleshooting tips for future network issues.


**Final Outcome:**

The issue was resolved by guiding the customer through a different Wi-Fi connection method.  The problem was likely caused by a temporary glitch within the Quick Start wizard on the device.  The customer is now able to successfully connect and use the Promethium X500.
