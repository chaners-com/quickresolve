# Ticket #040:  Account Locked - Unable to Access "Prolific Productivity" App

**Customer:**  Jane Doe (jane.doe@email.com)

**Date Submitted:** October 26, 2023

**Product:** Prolific Productivity (iOS App, Version 3.2.1)

**Problem:**

* Customer reports that her account was unexpectedly locked out.
* She received an email stating "Too many failed login attempts. Account temporarily locked."
* She claims she only attempted to log in twice, using her correct password.
* She's unable to reset her password using the in-app function, receiving an error message:  "Error Code: PP-403 - Password Reset Failed."

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Verified Account:** Confirmed customer email address and associated account.
2. **Password Reset Attempt:** Attempted a password reset via the support portal, bypassing the in-app function. This failed initially due to a known bug in the password reset system (Ticket #038 is addressing this).
3. **Manual Unlock:** Manually unlocked the customer's account from the admin panel.
4. **Temporary Password:** Provided the customer with a temporary password via email.
5. **Password Change Encouraged:** Instructed the customer to change her temporary password immediately upon logging in.
6. **Bug Report Acknowledgment:** Notified the customer that the in-app password reset issue is being addressed by the development team.

**Final Outcome:**

Customer account successfully unlocked. Customer confirmed successful login using the temporary password and has been instructed to change it.  The underlying password reset bug has been acknowledged in a separate ticket.
