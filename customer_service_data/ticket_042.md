# Ticket #042:  Login Issues with "Project Zenith" Mobile App

**Customer:**  Jane Doe (jane.doe@email.com)

**Reported Problem:**  Ms. Doe reported being unable to log into the Project Zenith mobile application (version 2.3.1) on her iPhone 13 (iOS 16.4). She receives the error message: "Authentication Failed. Please check your credentials and try again."  She's certain her password is correct and has tried resetting it twice via the in-app option, but the issue persists.


**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Confirmed Ms. Doe's account details.
* **Step 2:**  Checked server logs for any authentication errors related to her IP address (192.168.1.100) during login attempts. No errors were found, suggesting the issue is client-side.
* **Step 3:**  Advised Ms. Doe to check her device's date and time settings, ensuring they are accurate and automatically set.
* **Step 4:**  Ms. Doe confirmed her date and time were manually set and corrected them to automatic.
* **Step 5:**  Ms. Doe successfully logged into the app after correcting the date and time.

**Final Outcome:** Issue resolved.  Incorrect device date and time settings were preventing successful authentication.
