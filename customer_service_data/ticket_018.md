**Customer:** John Doe (jdoe@example.com)
**Product:**  CloudSync Pro

**Reported Problem:**

Customer reports being unable to access their CloudSync Pro account for the past 2 hours. They receive an "Error Code: 403 - Forbidden" message when attempting to log in via the web application and the desktop client.  They have tried restarting their computer and router.  They state that they have not changed their password recently.  They are concerned about data loss.


**Resolution Steps:**

* **Step 1:** Checked server status - All systems operational.
* **Step 2:** Confirmed customer's email address and password credentials (correct).
* **Step 3:** Investigated account activity logs. No unusual login attempts detected.
* **Step 4:**  Cleared customer's browser cache and cookies.
* **Step 5:**  Requested customer attempt login from a different browser (Chrome).  
* **Step 6:**  Problem persisted.  Suspected issue with account synchronization.
* **Step 7:**  Temporarily suspended and then reactivated the customer's account.

**Final Outcome:**

After reactivating the account, the customer was able to successfully log in.  The issue appears to have been a temporary synchronization problem on our server side.  The customer confirmed access and expressed satisfaction with the resolution.  Further monitoring of the account will be conducted as a precaution.
