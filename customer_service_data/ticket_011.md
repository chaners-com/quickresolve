# Ticket #011:  Unable to Access Cloud Storage - Account Locked

**Customer:**  Jane Doe (jane.doe@email.com)

**Product:**  CloudStore Pro

**Date Submitted:** October 26, 2023

**Reported Problem:**

Ms. Doe reports being unable to access her CloudStore Pro account.  She receives an error message: "Account Locked - Too many incorrect login attempts. Please contact support."  She states she's certain of her password and has tried several times without success. She also mentions attempting password reset, but the reset email never arrived.


**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Verified Ms. Doe's email address and account details.
* **Step 2:**  Investigated potential email delivery issues.  Discovered that a spam filter had flagged our password reset emails to her "junk" folder.
* **Step 3:**  Manually unlocked Ms. Doe's account.
* **Step 4:**  Instructed Ms. Doe to check her junk folder for the password reset email. 
* **Step 5:**  Confirmed with Ms. Doe that she received the email and successfully reset her password.
* **Step 6:**  Confirmed access to her CloudStore Pro account.


**Final Outcome:**

Ms. Doe's CloudStore Pro account was successfully unlocked, and she regained access after resetting her password.  The issue was caused by our password reset emails being filtered to her junk folder.  We advised Ms. Doe to add our email address (`noreply@cloudstorepro.com`) to her safe sender list.
