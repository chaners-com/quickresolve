# Ticket #005:  Account Locked - Unable to Access "Project Zenith" Software

**Customer:** John Smith (john.smith@example.com)

**Date Submitted:** 2024-10-27 10:35 AM PST

**Product:** Project Zenith v3.2.1 (Windows)

**Reported Problem:**

* Customer reports his account was unexpectedly locked out.  He received an email stating "Too many failed login attempts. Please contact support."  He claims he only attempted to log in twice. He's unable to access Project Zenith software and needs to complete urgent tasks.


**Resolution Process:**

1. **Verification:** Confirmed customer identity via email address and security questions.
2. **Account Check:** Reviewed login logs.  Identified three failed login attempts from an unusual IP address (192.168.1.100).  Suspected unauthorized access attempt.
3. **Password Reset:** Initiated a password reset request via email to john.smith@example.com.
4. **IP Address Restriction (Temporary):**  Temporarily blocked the suspect IP address (192.168.1.100) from accessing Project Zenith to prevent further unauthorized access.
5. **Security Advice:** Advised Mr. Smith to use a strong, unique password and enable two-factor authentication for enhanced security.

**Final Outcome:**

* Mr. Smith successfully reset his password and gained access to his Project Zenith account.  He confirmed that he had been experiencing intermittent network issues at his home and that his ISP's router may have briefly used the reported IP Address.


**Status:** Resolved
