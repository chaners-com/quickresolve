# Ticket #081:  Account Locked - Unable to Access "CloudSync Pro"

**Customer:**  John Doe (johndoe@email.com)

**Date Submitted:** 2024-10-27

**Product:** CloudSync Pro (Version 2.3.1)

**Reported Problem:**

Mr. Doe reports that his CloudSync Pro account has been locked out. He received an email stating his account was temporarily suspended due to "suspicious activity." He denies any such activity and has tried multiple times to reset his password via the website recovery process, but receives an error message: "Password reset request failed. Please contact support." He is unable to access his important business files.


**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Verified customer identity via email confirmation and security questions.
* **Step 2:** Investigated account activity logs. Found no suspicious login attempts originating from unusual locations or devices.  The "suspicious activity" flag appears to be a false positive triggered by a recent high volume of file uploads.
* **Step 3:** Manually unlocked Mr. Doe's CloudSync Pro account.
* **Step 4:** Provided Mr. Doe with temporary password via secure email.
* **Step 5:** Advised Mr. Doe to change his password upon logging in.
* **Step 6:** Explained the potential for false positives with the security system and reassured him of account security.

**Final Outcome:**

Mr. Doe's CloudSync Pro account was successfully unlocked. He confirmed successful access to his files and changed his password.  The issue was resolved and confirmed by email.
