# Ticket #071:  Unable to Access Cloud Storage - Account Locked

**Customer:** John Smith (john.smith@email.com)
**Product:** CloudDrive Pro

**Reported Problem:**

* Customer reports being unable to access his CloudDrive Pro account.  He receives an error message: "Account Locked: Too many failed login attempts. Please contact support."
* He states he has tried his password multiple times, and believes it is correct.  He suspects a possible autofill error might have inputted an incorrect password character on a previous attempt.
* He is concerned about the data stored on his account (approximately 50GB of business files).

**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Verified customer identity via email address and security questions.
* **Step 2:** Unlocked the customer's CloudDrive Pro account.
* **Step 3:** Advised the customer to change his password to a stronger, more secure password (at least 12 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols).  Guided him through the password reset process.
* **Step 4:** Confirmed successful login via a test login attempt with the new password.
* **Step 5:** Provided the customer with links to CloudDrive Pro's security best practices documentation.

**Final Outcome:**

Customer's CloudDrive Pro account was successfully unlocked. The customer successfully changed his password and confirmed access to his data.  The issue was resolved to the customer's satisfaction.  A follow-up email was sent to Mr. Smith confirming the resolution and providing additional security tips.
