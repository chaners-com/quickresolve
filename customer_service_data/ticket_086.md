# Ticket #086:  "Galaxy Note20 Ultra -  Unable to Connect to WiFi"

**Customer:** John Smith (john.smith@email.com)

**Date Submitted:** 2024-10-27

**Product:** Samsung Galaxy Note20 Ultra, Model SM-N986U

**Reported Problem:**

> "I'm unable to connect to my home Wi-Fi network. My phone shows 'Obtaining IP address...' indefinitely.  I've tried restarting my phone multiple times, and I can connect to other networks (like my neighbor's) without issue. My other devices connect to my home Wi-Fi perfectly fine.  The error message 'Authentication Problem' briefly appears before it reverts back to 'Obtaining IP address...'."


**Resolution Steps:**

* **Step 1:**  Confirmed customer's Wi-Fi network password accuracy.  Customer re-entered the password to ensure no typos.

* **Step 2:**  Advised the customer to forget the network on their phone and then re-add it. This cleared any potentially corrupted saved network settings.

* **Step 3:**  Requested the customer check their router's settings to ensure no MAC address filtering was blocking the phone's connection.  The customer confirmed no such filtering was in place.

* **Step 4:**  Suggested a router restart to refresh the network's DHCP lease.  Customer performed the restart and reported success.

* **Step 5:**  Asked the customer to test connection again.

**Final Outcome:**

The issue was resolved after a router restart. The customer is now successfully connected to their home Wi-Fi network.
