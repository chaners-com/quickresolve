**Reported Problem:**

Mr. Doe reports that he is unable to access his CloudSync Pro account. He received an email notification stating his account was locked due to "too many incorrect password attempts." He has tried resetting his password using the password reset link, but the link is either broken or not functioning correctly.

* **Step 4:**  Contacted Mr. Doe via email to inform him of the account unlock and to guide him through the password reset process again.
* **Step 5:**  Mr. Doe successfully logged into his account and confirmed the issue was resolved.


**Final Outcome:**

The customer's CloudSync Pro account was successfully unlocked. The issue appears to have been a temporary system glitch that prevented the correct processing of password reset requests. The password reset functionality is functioning correctly.
