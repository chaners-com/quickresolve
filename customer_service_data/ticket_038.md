**Date Submitted:** October 26, 2023

**Reported Problem:**

Mr. Doe reports he is unable to access his CloudDrive Pro account. He receives an "Account Locked: Too many failed login attempts" error message when attempting to log in. He states he is certain of his password and has tried resetting it multiple times via the password recovery link, but the email with the reset link never arrives.

**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Verified customer's email address and account details.

* **Step 3:**  Corrected the email address in the system to john.doe@email.com.
* **Step 4:**  Resent the password reset email to the corrected email address.
* **Step 5:** Confirmed email delivery was successful.
* **Step 6:**  Mr. Doe confirmed receipt of the password reset email and successfully reset his password.
* **Step 7:**  Mr. Doe successfully logged into his CloudDrive Pro account.


**Final Outcome:**

The issue was resolved by correcting the typo in the customer's registered email address and resending the password reset email.  Account access has been restored.
