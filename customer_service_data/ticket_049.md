# Ticket #049:  Account Locked - Unable to Access "Prolific Planner" App

**Customer:** John Smith (john.smith@email.com)

**Date Submitted:** October 26, 2023

**Product:** Prolific Planner Mobile App (iOS)

**Reported Problem:**

* Customer reports being unable to access their Prolific Planner account.  They receive an error message: "Account temporarily locked due to too many incorrect password attempts. Please reset your password."
* They claim they have not forgotten their password and suspect a keyboard issue may be responsible for the lock.
* They have tried resetting their password via the in-app process, but the reset email is not arriving in their inbox.


**Resolution Process:**

1. **Checked Spam/Junk Folders:** Confirmed the password reset email was not in the customer's spam or junk folders.
2. **Verified Email Address:** Confirmed the email address associated with the account was accurate (john.smith@email.com).
3. **Manually Reset Password:**  Administered a password reset from the backend system.  A new temporary password was generated: "TempP@sswOrd123!"
4. **Notified Customer:** Sent an email to john.smith@email.com with the temporary password and instructions to change it upon login.  Confirmation email sent when password was changed successfully.
5. **Investigated Email Delivery:**  Initial investigation of email delivery logs showed no issues.  Issue may have been temporary server lag.

**Final Outcome:**

Customer confirmed successful account access using the temporary password and subsequently changed their password.  The issue was resolved.
