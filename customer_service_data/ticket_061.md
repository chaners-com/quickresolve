# Ticket #061:  Account Locked - Unable to Access "ProWorkflow" App

**Customer:**  John Smith (john.smith@email.com)

**Date Submitted:** 2024-10-27

**Product:** ProWorkflow Mobile App (iOS)

**Reported Problem:**

Mr. Smith reports that his ProWorkflow mobile app account is locked. He receives an error message: "Account temporarily locked due to too many incorrect login attempts. Please reset your password." He has tried resetting his password using the in-app option and the website, but continues to receive the same error.  He states he is certain of his password and believes there may be a problem with the app or server.

**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Verified customer identity via email address and phone number on file.
* **Step 2:** Attempted a password reset via the ProWorkflow website.  Success! A temporary password was generated and sent to john.smith@email.com.
* **Step 3:** Advised Mr. Smith to use the temporary password to log in to the mobile app.
* **Step 4:** Confirmed successful login via follow-up email.  Mr. Smith reported no further issues.
* **Step 5:**  Investigated potential server-side issues causing lockouts; found no widespread problems, suggesting a user-specific issue (likely due to typos in password entry).

**Final Outcome:**

Issue resolved. Account unlocked successfully.  Mr. Smith is now able to access the ProWorkflow Mobile App.
