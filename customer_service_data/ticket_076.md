# Ticket #076:  "CloudSync Pro" - File Sync Failure

**Customer:** John Smith (john.smith@email.com)

**Product:** CloudSync Pro (Version 2.3.1)

**Date Submitted:** 2024-10-27

**Reported Problem:**

Mr. Smith reported that his CloudSync Pro application is failing to sync files from his local machine to his cloud storage (Google Drive). He receives the error message: "Synchronization Failed: Network Error (Code: 403)". He has checked his internet connection, which is stable, and verified his Google Drive credentials are correct.  He's lost approximately 100MB of unsynced data since the issue began yesterday.


**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Confirmed Mr. Smith's internet connectivity and Google Drive account access.  All appeared normal.
* **Step 2:** Checked CloudSync Pro's log files for more detailed error information. Found a secondary error indicating a potential conflict with another application using the same Google Drive API credentials (likely a personal project).
* **Step 3:** Advised Mr. Smith to temporarily disable any other applications accessing his Google Drive account.
* **Step 4:**  After disabling a personal Python script,  CloudSync Pro successfully synced all pending files.
* **Step 5:** Confirmed with Mr. Smith that the sync was complete and his data was recovered.  Suggested monitoring his other applications accessing the Google Drive account to avoid future conflicts.

**Final Outcome:**

The issue was resolved by identifying and disabling a conflicting application using the same Google Drive API credentials. All pending files were successfully synced, and Mr. Smith's data was recovered.
