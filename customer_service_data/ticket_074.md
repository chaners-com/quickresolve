**Product:**  SecureCloud Pro

**Date Submitted:** 2024-10-27

**Reported Problem:**

Ms. Doe reports she is unable to log in to her SecureCloud Pro account. She receives an "Incorrect Password" error message even after multiple attempts.  She states she's certain she's using the correct password, and has tried resetting it via the "Forgot Password" link, but the reset email never arrives. She also mentioned she last accessed her account three days ago without issue.


**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Checked SecureCloud Pro server logs for login attempts from Ms. Doe's IP address. No unusual activity was detected.
* **Step 2:** Verified Ms. Doe's email address (jane.doe@email.com) was correct in our system.
* **Step 3:** Manually reset Ms. Doe's password.  A new temporary password was generated and sent to her registered email address via a separate secure email channel. 
* **Step 4:** Confirmed email delivery via our email server logs.
* **Step 5:**  Followed up with Ms. Doe via email (ticket#074_response@securecloudpro.com) confirming password reset and guiding her through the login process with the temporary password. She was instructed to then change her password to a new, secure one.

**Final Outcome:**

Ms. Doe successfully logged in using the temporary password and subsequently changed her password. The issue was resolved. She confirmed successful login and expressed satisfaction with the resolution.
