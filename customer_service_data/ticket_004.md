# Ticket #004:  Account Login Issue - "Incorrect Password" Error

**Customer:** John Doe (john.doe@email.com)
**Product:**  SecureCloud Pro

**Reported Problem:**

Mr. Doe reports he is unable to log into his SecureCloud Pro account. He receives an "Incorrect Password" error message despite claiming he's using the correct password. He's tried resetting his password via the "Forgot Password" link, but the email with the reset link never arrives.  He also states he has checked his spam folder.


**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Checked account status. Account is active and in good standing.
* **Step 2:** Confirmed email address validity.  Email address john.doe@email.com appears correct in our system.
* **Step 3:** Manually triggered a password reset email.  We sent a new password reset email to john.doe@email.com.
* **Step 4:**  Requested Mr. Doe check his spam and junk folders again, and to add "noreply@securecloudpro.com" to his safe senders list.
* **Step 5:**  Followed up with Mr. Doe via email after 10 minutes.  He confirmed receipt of the password reset email and successfully logged in.


**Final Outcome:**

The issue was resolved by manually triggering a password reset email.  Mr. Doe was able to successfully log in after receiving and using the reset link.  We advised him to add "noreply@securecloudpro.com" to his safe senders list to prevent future email delivery issues.
