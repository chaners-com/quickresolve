**Reported Problem:**

Ms. Doe reports that her Prolific Planner app account is locked. She received an email stating "Too many incorrect login attempts. Please reset your password."

* **Step 6:**  Provided additional security tips, including the use of a strong password manager.


**Final Outcome:**

Ms. Doe's account was successfully unlocked, and she was able to log in successfully.  The issue was likely caused by a minor glitch in the password reset system.  Customer reported satisfaction.
