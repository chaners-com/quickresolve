# Ticket #003:  "Sign-in Error on StellarNote App - iOS"

**Customer:**  Jane Doe (jane.doe@email.com)

**Date Submitted:** 2024-10-27

**Product:** StellarNote Mobile App (iOS v2.3.1)

**Reported Problem:**

> "I am unable to log into my StellarNote account on my iPhone.  I keep getting an error message that says "Authentication Failed: Invalid Credentials". I've tried resetting my password multiple times using the password reset function within the app, but the problem persists.  My account is definitely active, as I can access it through the web interface on my computer."


**Resolution Steps:**

* **Step 1:** Confirmed customer's email address and account status. Account is active and in good standing.
* **Step 2:**  Asked the customer to check her iPhone's date and time settings to ensure they are accurate and set to "Automatic".  Customer confirmed they were not set to automatic.
* **Step 3:**  Instructed the customer to set her iPhone's date and time to "Automatic".
* **Step 4:**  Requested the customer to try logging into the StellarNote app again.


**Final Outcome:**

The customer successfully logged into her StellarNote account after correcting her iPhone's date and time settings.  The issue was resolved by synchronizing the device's clock with network time.  The "Authentication Failed: Invalid Credentials" error was a result of a time synchronization issue causing a mismatch between the device's timestamp and the server's timestamp.
