**Reported Problem:**

Customer reports being unable to access their Project Zenith dashboard.  Upon attempting login, they receive the following error message:  "Account Locked: Too many incorrect login attempts. Please contact support."  Mr. Smith assures us he has the correct password and believes the issue may be due to a recent password change on a secondary device.  He is concerned about missing important deadlines related to his ongoing project.

**Resolution Process:**

* **10:45 AM:** Ticket assigned to Support Agent, Sarah Chen.
* **10:50 AM:** Agent Chen contacted Mr. Smith via email to verify his identity.
* **10:55 AM:** Identity verified.  Agent Chen unlocked Mr. Smith's account.
* **11:00 AM:**  Agent Chen emailed Mr. Smith instructions on how to change his password for enhanced security, emphasizing the importance of using a strong, unique password.  The link provided includes a guide to generating strong passwords.
* **11:15 AM:** Mr. Smith confirmed successful login and password change.

**Final Outcome:**

Account successfully unlocked. Password successfully changed. Customer issue resolved.

**Keywords/Tags:** Account Locked, Password Reset, Project Zenith, Login Error, Security, Account Recovery

**Agent Notes:**  Customer was very appreciative of the prompt resolution.  This is a recurring issue; perhaps we should add more robust account lockout protection with less stringent limits on incorrect login attempts and provide clearer instructions on password security best practices during account creation.
