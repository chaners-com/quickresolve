# Ticket #023:  Account Login Issue -  "Incorrect Password" Error

**Customer:** John Smith (john.smith@email.com)
**Product:**  ChronoSync Pro v3.2.1
**Date Submitted:** 2024-10-27 10:35 AM PST

**Reported Problem:**

Customer reports being unable to log into their ChronoSync Pro account.  They receive an "Incorrect Password" error message despite claiming to be entering the correct password. They have tried resetting their password using the "Forgot Password" function, but the reset email is not arriving in their inbox.  They suspect a problem with their email provider or ChronoSync's password reset system.


**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:**  Checked customer's email address for typos.  Confirmed john.smith@email.com is correct.
* **Step 2:**  Investigated email server logs for ChronoSync's password reset emails. Found no emails sent to john.smith@email.com in the last hour.  Notified email server admin to investigate their spam filters.
* **Step 3:**  Manually reset the customer's password and emailed a temporary password to john.smith@email.com  from a different email address (support@chronosyncpro.com) to bypass potential email provider issues.
* **Step 4:**  Confirmed with the customer that they received the email containing the temporary password. They were able to successfully log in.
* **Step 5:**  Advised the customer to change their password to a strong and unique one after logging in.
* **Step 6:**  Contacted email server admin, confirming that there was a brief disruption to their outgoing mail server which was now resolved.


**Final Outcome:**

Issue resolved.  Customer successfully logged in using the temporary password.  Customer advised on password security best practices.
