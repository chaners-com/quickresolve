# Ticket #056:  Account Locked - Unable to Access "ProjectZenith" App

**Customer:**  Jane Doe (jane.doe@email.com)

**Date Submitted:** 2024-10-27 10:30 AM PST

**Product:** ProjectZenith Mobile App (iOS v3.2.1)

**Reported Problem:**

Ms. Doe reports that her account is locked and she's unable to access the ProjectZenith app. She received an error message: "Account temporarily locked due to too many incorrect login attempts. Please reset your password."  She has tried resetting her password multiple times via the in-app function, but the reset email is not arriving in her inbox. She suspects this may be due to a typo in her registered email address (she recently changed jobs).

**Resolution Steps:**

* **10:45 AM:**  Confirmed Ms. Doe's registered email address via our database.  A typo was found:  "jane.doe@emai.com" (missing an 'l').
* **10:50 AM:** Corrected the email address in our system.
* **10:55 AM:** Sent a password reset email to the corrected address (jane.doe@email.com).
* **11:00 AM:**  Confirmed via email that Ms. Doe received and used the password reset link successfully.


**Final Outcome:**

Ms. Doe's account is unlocked and she has successfully logged back into the ProjectZenith app. The issue was resolved by correcting a typographical error in her registered email address.
