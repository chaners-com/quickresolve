# Ticket #009:  "ChronoSync Pro" - Synchronization Failure

**Customer:** John Smith (john.smith@email.com)

**Product:** ChronoSync Pro v. 8.0.3

**Date Submitted:** 2024-10-27

**Reported Problem:**

Mr. Smith reported that ChronoSync Pro is failing to synchronize his MacBook Pro (macOS Ventura 13.5) with his external Seagate Backup Plus Drive. He receives the error message:  "Synchronization Failed:  An unexpected error occurred.  Error code:  CS-1047". He attempted to restart both his computer and the external drive, but the problem persists.  He states he's been using ChronoSync successfully for over a year.

**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Verified ChronoSync Pro license was active (confirmed).
* **Step 2:** Checked the external drive for errors using Disk Utility (no errors found).
* **Step 3:**  Checked system logs for any related errors (found numerous "I/O timeout" errors related to the external drive).
* **Step 4:**  Recommended the customer to try a different USB port on his MacBook Pro.
* **Step 5:**  Advised the customer to check the USB cable for damage or loose connections.
* **Step 6:** Customer reported that switching to a different USB port resolved the issue.  Synchronization completed successfully.

**Final Outcome:**

The issue was resolved by using a different USB port. The problem appears to have been a faulty USB port on the customer's MacBook, rather than a problem with ChronoSync Pro itself.  The customer confirmed successful synchronization.
