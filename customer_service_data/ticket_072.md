# Ticket #072:  Slow Download Speeds -  "CloudSync Pro" Application

**Customer:** John Smith (john.smith@email.com)

**Date Submitted:** October 26, 2023

**Product:** CloudSync Pro (Version 3.2.1)

**Reported Problem:**

Mr. Smith reports significantly slower than usual download speeds using the CloudSync Pro application. He states that large files (over 1GB) are taking upwards of 12 hours to download, whereas previously they would download in 2-3 hours. He has attached screenshots showing download speeds averaging 50kbps, far below his expected speeds of at least 5Mbps.  He receives no error messages during the download process, the application simply proceeds very slowly. His internet connection speed is verified as being 100Mbps down/50Mbps up.


**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:**  Confirmed customer's internet connection speed via external speed test (Ookla Speedtest). Results confirmed 100Mbps down/50Mbps up.
* **Step 2:** Checked CloudSync Pro application logs for any errors or unusual activity. No errors were found.
* **Step 3:**  Advised customer to restart the CloudSync Pro application and his computer.
* **Step 4:**  Suggested customer temporarily disable any other applications or processes that might be consuming significant bandwidth.
* **Step 5:**  Recommended clearing the CloudSync Pro application cache and temporary files.
* **Step 6:**  Asked the customer to try a different download location (different folder on the same computer).
* **Step 7:**  After steps 3-6, download speeds still remained slow.  A remote desktop session was initiated with the customer (with his permission) to inspect his system further.
* **Step 8:** Identified a significant number of fragmented files on the customer's hard drive.  Suggested running a disk defragmentation utility.


**Final Outcome:**

After running a disk defragmentation, download speeds improved significantly, averaging 8Mbps.  Mr. Smith confirmed that the issue is resolved.  The slow download speeds were likely due to hard drive fragmentation hindering efficient file writing.

**Status:** Resolved
