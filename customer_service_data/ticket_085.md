# Ticket #085:  Login Issues with "CloudSync Pro" App - iOS

**Customer:**  Jane Doe (jane.doe@email.com)

**Date Submitted:** 2024-10-27

**Reported Problem:**

Ms. Doe reports being unable to log into her CloudSync Pro app (version 3.2.1) on her iPhone 14.  She receives the error message: "Invalid credentials. Please check your username and password."  She's certain her password is correct and has tried resetting it multiple times via the app's "Forgot Password" function.  She's also tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app without success.

**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:**  Verified Ms. Doe's email address and confirmed her account exists in our system.
* **Step 2:**  Advised Ms. Doe to check for any typos in her username.  She confirmed she was using the correct username.
* **Step 3:**  Suggested checking her device's date and time settings to ensure they were accurate.  (Time synchronization issues can sometimes interfere with logins).
* **Step 4:**  Asked Ms. Doe to try logging in via a different network (e.g., switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data).
* **Step 5:**  Since the problem persisted, we temporarily disabled her account to prevent further failed login attempts, then re-enabled it.  This sometimes resolves minor account glitches.
* **Step 6:**  Ms. Doe was successfully able to log in after the account was re-enabled.

**Final Outcome:**

The issue was resolved by temporarily disabling and re-enabling Ms. Doe's CloudSync Pro account.  She confirmed successful login and functionality.
