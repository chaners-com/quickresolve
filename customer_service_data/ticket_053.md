# Ticket #053:  Unable to Access Cloud Storage - "Error Code: 403"

**Customer:**  John Doe (john.doe@example.com)
**Product:**  CloudSync Pro

**Reported Problem:**

Customer reports being unable to access his CloudSync Pro account. He receives a "Error Code: 403 - Forbidden" message when attempting to log in via the web application and mobile app. He states he has tried resetting his password multiple times using the password reset link, but the issue persists.  He also reports that he hasn't changed any security settings recently.


**Resolution Process:**

* **Step 1:** Confirmed customer's email address and account details.
* **Step 2:** Checked server logs for any unusual activity related to the customer's account. No unusual login attempts were detected.
* **Step 3:**  Confirmed that the customer's email address was not blocked.
* **Step 4:**  Manually reset the customer's password and sent a temporary password via email to john.doe@example.com.
* **Step 5:**  Instructed the customer to try logging in again using the temporary password.
* **Step 6:**  Confirmed successful login with the customer via phone call.  We walked him through changing his password to a new secure one.

**Final Outcome:**

The issue was resolved by manually resetting the customer's password. The problem was likely caused by a temporary glitch in the password reset system. The customer was able to successfully access his CloudSync Pro account and confirmed his satisfaction.
