**Resolution Steps:**

* **Step 1:** Verified user account credentials. Confirmed Mr. Smith's username and password were correct.
* **Step 2:** Checked CloudSync Pro server status. No reported outages or maintenance were scheduled.
* **Step 3:** Investigated potential browser caching issues.  Requested Mr. Smith clear his browser cache and cookies.
* **Step 4:** Checked for any network connectivity issues on Mr. Smith's end. Ping tests were successful.
* **Step 5:** After the cache clear, the issue persisted.  We remotely checked Mr. Smith's CloudSync Pro application logs.  A firewall rule was blocking access to the CloudSync Pro server.  
* **Step 6:** Provided Mr. Smith with instructions on temporarily disabling his firewall to test connectivity.
* **Step 7:** After disabling the firewall, Mr. Smith was able to access his files successfully.
* **Step 8:**  Advised Mr. Smith to add an exception for CloudSync Pro (port 443) to his firewall to prevent this issue from recurring.


**Final Outcome:**

The issue was resolved by identifying and addressing a firewall rule blocking access to the CloudSync Pro server.  Mr. Smith was able to regain access to his files and provided confirmation.
